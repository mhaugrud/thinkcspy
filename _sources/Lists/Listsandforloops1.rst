List Traversal by Item
----------------------

We can perform **list traversal** by iterating over the items in a list.


.. activecode:: chp09_03a

    fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "cherry"]

    for afruit in fruits:     # by item
        print(afruit)

It almost reads like natural language: For (every) fruit in (the list of) fruits,
print (the name of the) fruit.
